# Wii Linux 6.18 GX port test ledger

This ledger tracks the modern-kernel port of the Wii VI framebuffer and the
reloadable GX accelerator. Hardware conclusions require a committed source
state and a checksum-verified deployed image.

## 2026-07-28: CPU framebuffer positive control (invalid build)

- Source implementation: `89a40599d` (`video: fbdev: port the Wii VI
  framebuffer to Linux 6.18`)
- Deployment helper state: `9ad81d7be238`
- Deployed image SHA-256:
  `cfb0877630a343ad8b28b3b1483b6916905ce0e9f203b435bb48a0de05f21c2c`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #9 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 15:15:21 CDT 2026`

Wi-Fi and SSH passed: `wlan0` associated, received `10.3.10.12`, and accepted
the restored root public key when the client enabled `ssh-rsa` compatibility
for the rootfs's OpenSSH 6.7 server.

The framebuffer test is invalid, not negative. `/proc/fb` was empty and no
`gcn-vifb` platform driver appeared. Runtime config inspection showed
`CONFIG_FB=y` and `CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y`, but no
`CONFIG_FB_GAMECUBE=y`. The build had reused a stale `.config`; adding the
symbol to `wii_defconfig` does not update an existing `.config` through an
incremental build.

The deployment helper now runs `make wii_defconfig` before every build and
refuses to continue unless `.config` contains `CONFIG_FB_GAMECUBE=y`. Retest
the CPU framebuffer before porting or loading any GX accelerator code.

## 2026-07-28: CPU framebuffer probe with corrected config

- Source implementation: `89a40599d`
- Deployed image SHA-256:
  `03601c0fbd69889d5a8033fff7be0f37ddc0821ca7e2098767681a6ba791f974`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #10 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 15:47:50 CDT 2026`

The corrected image contained `CONFIG_FB_GAMECUBE=y`. The platform driver
registered and bound to `c002000.video`, proving the Kconfig, build, DT match,
and initcall paths. Probe then failed with `-EIO` after both
`request_mem_region()` and `ioremap()` rejected XFB physical range
`0x01698000+0x00168000`.

This is expected modern-kernel behavior: the DTS reserves the XFB with
`/memreserve/`, but it remains classified as System RAM. Modern PowerPC does
not permit an `ioremap()` alias of System RAM. Use `memremap(...,
MEMREMAP_WB)` to obtain the direct mapping and explicitly flush CPU-written
XFB cache lines before the noncoherent VI scans them.

The same boot also confirmed that the rootfs's static `/dev/console` is a
regular file and `CONFIG_DEVTMPFS` was disabled. Enable devtmpfs in
`wii_defconfig`; the external `init-diag.sh` has already been updated to mount
it, stop repeating physical-card pull banners, and launch a local shell when
`/dev/fb0` exists.

## 2026-07-28: CPU framebuffer positive control passed

- XFB mapping implementation: `204740990`
- Deployed image SHA-256:
  `ec7660bd41bea735994f45463ed5077e5ecfad8a119271b7e0b4eed58572da52`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #11 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 16:55:32 CDT 2026`

All positive controls passed:

- `gcn-vifb` bound to `c002000.video` without warnings or faults.
- `/proc/fb` reported `0 gcn-vifb`.
- fbcon switched to an 80x30 color framebuffer console.
- sysfs reported 640x480, 16 bits per pixel.
- devtmpfs provided real `/dev/console`, `/dev/tty0`, and `/dev/fb0` nodes.
- Wi-Fi retained `10.3.10.12` and key-based SSH remained stable.
- A marker written remotely to `/dev/tty0` was visually confirmed on the Wii.

The CPU RGB565-to-YUYV path on Linux 6.18 is therefore the new known-good
fallback baseline. Proceed with the separately reloadable GX accelerator;
module unload must restore this exact live CPU console.

## 2026-07-28: First reloadable GX module cycle passed

- GX module implementation: `9500ee207`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `fcd616b8c19c98e2ff061020cbfcfbafe62de5d0d1895beca0d42e35e5700c2c`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=reference hold_frame=1`

The module loaded successfully, registered with gcnfb, mapped PE finish hwirq
10 to Linux IRQ 23, and completed the seed, copy-clear, libogc init, and two
reference-renderer submissions. Every FIFO drained to `RDoff == WToff`; all
four PE finish IRQs arrived; token waits completed in 310-860 microseconds.

The displayed GX frame was visually confirmed blurry, reproducing the known
3.15 accelerator defect on Linux 6.18. This is a useful reproduction, not a
port regression: `rmmod gcn_gx` immediately restored the clear live CPU
console without reboot, also visually confirmed. Wi-Fi and SSH remained live.

The modern reloadable investigation loop is therefore validated. Subsequent
GX-only changes require only `tools/wii-gx-cycle.sh`; no kernel rebuild, card
movement, or rootfs write is needed unless reserved-memory requirements
change.

## 2026-07-28: Generated renderer bounded-frame control

- Source state: `f9cc3d1927a3`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `fcd616b8c19c98e2ff061020cbfcfbafe62de5d0d1895beca0d42e35e5700c2c`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated hold_frame=1`

The generated renderer completed the same seed, copy-clear, isolated libogc
init, and two live-frame submissions as the reference test. All four PE
finish IRQs arrived, token waits completed in 410-860 microseconds, and every
FIFO submission drained to `RDoff == WToff`. The VFB and tiled-texture digest
sums matched for both captured live frames.

A full-frame capture from the live webcam feed showed real spatial
corruption: console content was compressed and repeated in several vertical
regions, with additional vertical duplication. This is materially different
from a solid copy-clear result and proves that the generated path publishes
changing framebuffer content, but with incorrect texture sampling or display
layout. After `rmmod gcn_gx`, a second full-frame capture showed the clear,
full-width CPU console. The camera and VI mode are therefore valid controls;
the repeated layout is produced by the GX path.

Next isolate texture geometry before changing raster state. The source and
tiled-buffer digests matching rules out corruption in the CPU tiling loop,
but does not validate the GX texture dimensions, format, cache/TMEM state,
texture coordinates, or EFB-to-XFB copy stride.

## 2026-07-28: Texture geometry passed, sharpness failed

- Test implementation: `8e376ece808f`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `842c368f90d943cfbaad3dfba8c4190dc384b020ce574014f15e0fd714a8eff3`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The deterministic tiled RGB565 texture rendered with correct large-scale
geometry on real hardware. A full-frame webcam capture showed the expected
red upper-left, dark-green upper-right, blue lower-left, and white lower-right
quadrants. Black 32-pixel grid lines covered the full frame and the yellow
diagonal markers crossed the expected geometry. The user directly observed
that the GX output was blurry, however, while the CPU-console control after
module unload was sharp. This is a spatial-layout positive control, not an
image-quality positive control.

All four PE finish IRQs arrived, token waits completed in 410-860
microseconds, and every FIFO drained to `RDoff == WToff`. Both texture buffers
produced the same deterministic digest (`crc=a05bcbcf`, `sum=30d9faae`,
`xor=0410`, `nz=288345`). Module unload then restored the clear CPU console,
also confirmed with a full-frame capture.

Because the pattern uses the same MEM1 buffers, cache flush, RGB565 texture
descriptor, generated command state, draw geometry, EFB copy, XFB stride, and
presentation path as the corrupt console test, it rules out gross dimension,
axis, tiling-block, viewport, and stride mistakes. It does not rule out
half-texel sampling, texture filtering, EFB copy filtering, or another
downstream quality issue. The repeated/compressed console layout may still
involve the live VFB contract or linear-to-tiled copy, but the shared blur
requires auditing the GX sampling and copy-filter state first.

## 2026-07-28: Narrow display-copy filter did not fix blur

- Test implementation: `d6c394313cbf`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `c6ad95d20beced0534d1764ed76d7c43badcc6cc924cdf1575ce2b187c49d424`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

This test changed only display-copy filter BP registers 0x53 and 0x54. The
previous values encoded the broad video-mode coefficients
`[8,8,10,12,10,8,8]`, despite a source comment claiming `vf=false`. The test
used libogc's exact `GX_SetCopyFilter(GX_FALSE, NULL, GX_FALSE, NULL)` values,
which encode `[0,0,21,22,21,0,0]`.

The user still observed blurry GX output, and a full-frame webcam capture
showed no meaningful sharpness improvement over the broad-filter capture.
FIFO drains, PE finish IRQs, tokens, pattern digest, and spatial geometry all
remained correct. Module unload restored the CPU console.

The broad seven-tap copy filter is therefore ruled out as the primary blur
cause. Keep the narrow values because they accurately implement the stated
`vf=false` policy, but do not credit them as a visual fix. Next render a
hard-edged direct-color EFB pattern without texture sampling, then copy it
through the same XFB path. A sharp direct-color result implicates texture
sampling; a blurry result implicates the EFB-copy/presentation path.

## 2026-07-28: Direct-color EFB pattern was clear

- Test implementation: `acc19b0770dc`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `c6037cd65e8d83f20026f7f1869820a21c3a015710819a159b6abdac507b04b8`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=console hold_frame=1`

The direct renderer bypassed VFB reads, linear-to-tiled conversion, MEM1
texture buffers, texture descriptors, texture coordinates, TMEM, and texture
sampling. It drew four vertex-color quadrants and a two-pixel 32x32 black grid
directly into the EFB, then used the same PE fence, EFB-to-XFB copy, XFB
stride, VI scanout, and presentation path as the blurry textured tests.

The user observed a clear image. A full-frame webcam capture independently
confirmed materially sharp grid edges and quadrant boundaries. All four PE
finish IRQs arrived, token waits completed in 410-420 microseconds, and FIFO
submissions drained to `RDoff == WToff`; the direct frame used 2688 command
bytes. Module unload restored the CPU console.

This is a valid positive control for the downstream display path. EFB copy,
the narrow BP 0x53/0x54 filter, XFB stride, VI presentation, and the capture
path do not cause the texture blur. The remaining blur is in the texture path:
texture coordinates, LOD/filter state, TMEM/cache behavior, or sampling. The
correct large-scale textured-pattern geometry makes a gross coordinate or
dimension error unlikely. Audit BP 0x80 texMode0 encoding first, especially
min/mag filter and LOD fields, against libogc and Dolphin.

## 2026-07-29: Near-identity copy filter still blurry

- Test implementation: `be2d3c13943a`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`

- Runtime kernel before the post-test restart:
  `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The copy filter used `[0,0,0,63,1,0,0]`, the closest unity-sum hardware
filter to an identity operation because each coefficient is only six bits.
The user still observed blurry output. A full-frame webcam capture obtained
while the frame was held confirmed that the one-pixel grid remained visibly
degraded. FIFO drains, PE IRQs, token waits, texture digest, and pattern
geometry all passed as before.

The Wii was manually restarted after the visual result and capture, before a
same-boot unload recovery control could be trusted. The next boot reached
Wi-Fi and SSH normally with no GX module loaded. Do not classify the restart
as either a GX crash or a clean unload result.

This rules out programmable EFB vertical filtering as the primary blur cause,
including the broad seven-tap, libogc three-tap, and near-identity variants.
Retest the direct-color pattern with a one-pixel grid to match feature width;
without that control, the clear two-pixel direct pattern does not yet prove
that texture sampling alone causes the degradation.

## 2026-07-29: One-pixel direct grid reproducibly copied purple clear

- Test implementation: `e2833fa2608e`
- Kernel image SHA-256:

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=console hold_frame=1`

This changed only the direct diagnostic's vertical and horizontal grid
rectangles from two pixels wide to one. The test was run twice with identical
module bytes. Both runs displayed a uniform purple diagnostic clear rather
than any quadrants or grid. Each run still received all PE finish IRQs and
tokens and drained the 2688-byte direct FIFO to `RDoff == WToff`. Same-boot
module unload restored the CPU console after the second run.

The webcam was unavailable, so this result is based on two matching direct
user observations and kernel logs, not a saved full-frame capture. Purple is
a categorical primitive-missing result rather than a sharpness judgment; it
does not satisfy the intended one-pixel quality comparison. Do not retract
the earlier clear two-pixel direct result.

The one-pixel change was made after switching the copy filter from libogc's
three-tap values to the near-identity values, so two differences exist versus
the clear direct test. Restore the two-pixel grid while retaining the
near-identity filter. A clear result isolates one-pixel geometry; purple
instead implicates the filter-state change or test chronology.

## 2026-07-29: Two-pixel direct grid also purple under identity filter

- Kernel image SHA-256:

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=console hold_frame=1`

Restoring the direct grid to two pixels while retaining the custom
`[0,0,0,63,1,0,0]` copy filter still produced a uniform purple diagnostic
clear. All FIFO, PE, token, and same-boot unload controls passed. The webcam
remained unavailable, so this is a direct user-observed color result.

This rules out one-pixel geometry as the cause of the preceding purple runs.
The custom near-identity filter is the remaining controlled difference from
the earlier clear two-pixel direct test and is not a valid diagnostic baseline
on this hardware, regardless of its nominal unity coefficient sum. Revert to
libogc's `vf=false` `[0,0,21,22,21,0,0]` state and revalidate the direct
positive control before investigating texture sharpness further.

## 2026-07-29: Fresh-boot sequence proves missing GX initialization state

- Test implementation: `d48140133a95`
- Kernel image SHA-256:

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`

After the user's manual restart, the restored libogc-filter, two-pixel direct
renderer displayed purple rather than the grid. This module checksum is
byte-for-byte identical to the earlier `acc19b0770dc` module that produced a
clear grid and full-frame capture. The same current module was then exercised
without another reboot in this sequence:

1. `renderer=direct texture_source=console hold_frame=1`: purple clear.
2. `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`: purple clear.
3. `renderer=reference texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`: lime-green
   clear, matching the captured reference stream's own EFB clear color.

Every run drained its FIFO, received all PE finish IRQs and tokens, and
unloaded back to the CPU console. The webcam was unavailable; colors were
reported directly by the user. Both generated and byte-replayed libogc
primitives therefore failed to alter the EFB while copy-clear remained
functional.

This supersedes the attempted filter-based explanation. Identical module
bytes can produce visible primitives or only clear colors depending on prior
GX/boot state. The driver's partial `gx_load_libogc_init_preamble()` does not
establish a self-contained raster pipeline and relies on residual state from
Mini, an earlier application, or an earlier module sequence. Stop varying
filters and geometry. Capture or reconstruct complete libogc `GX_Init()`
state, validate it from a cold/fresh boot, and only then resume texture-quality
work.

## 2026-07-29: Vertex-cache invalidation did not restore primitives

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=console hold_frame=1`

The initialization preamble emitted libogc's standalone `GX_InvVtxCache()`
FIFO opcode `0x48`, which was a real command missing from the driver. The
direct renderer still displayed purple. FIFO, PE, token, and same-boot unload
controls passed. The webcam remained unavailable.

Keep the invalidation because it is part of canonical `GX_Init()`, but rule it
out as an isolated fix. The old 3.15 ledger records a more relevant ordering
control: prepending the conservative preamble and the first exact reference
texture frame in one contiguous submission eliminated green draw failures on
seven of seven cold boots. The modern reference path currently sends its
preamble in an earlier, separate init submission. Restore the validated
contiguous ordering before expanding the preamble further.

## 2026-07-29: Contiguous preamble still green in warm-state test

- Kernel image SHA-256:

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=reference texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The first exact reference frame contained the conservative preamble in the
same submission and drained the expected padded `WT=RD=0x03e0`. The user still
observed lime green, matching the captured frame's clear color. All PE, token,
and same-boot unload controls passed. The webcam remained unavailable.

This run occurred after many module state permutations on one boot and its
preamble also contained the newly added `GX_InvVtxCache()` opcode, unlike the
old seven-of-seven cold-boot control. It therefore proves that contiguous
ordering is not sufficient to recover the current warm GX state, but it is not
an exact rejection of the historical startup result. Remove the unhelpful
opcode and retest the exact historical stream after a real full power-off boot.

## 2026-07-29: Historical contiguous preamble restores cold-boot primitives

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=reference texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The Wii was fully powered off before this run. After boot, `uptime` reported
less than one minute and no `gcn_gx` module was loaded, validating the intended
cold-start condition. This build removed the newly added `GX_InvVtxCache()`
opcode while retaining the historical conservative initialization preamble
contiguous with the first exact reference frame.

The deterministic four-quadrant grid pattern became visible. The user judged
it blurry, but this is categorically different from the lime-green copy-clear
seen in the preceding warm-state run: GX primitives altered the EFB on this
cold boot. The first combined frame had the expected padded size of 992 bytes
(`WT=RD=0x03e0`), every PE token completed, every FIFO drained, and same-boot
module unload restored the CPU console. The webcam remained unavailable, so
the visual result is based on direct user observation rather than a saved
full-frame capture.

This reproduces the important direction of the old 3.15 seven-of-seven result
on Linux 6.18: the conservative preamble must be contiguous with the first
reference draw, and startup state matters. Treat primitive visibility and
image sharpness as separate problems. Preserve this checksum-backed stream as
the cold-start positive control. Before changing filters or texture state,
repeat it across cold boots to establish reliability, then compare a direct
renderer whose first draw is preceded by the same contiguous preamble. A
successful direct comparison will isolate the remaining blur to texture input
or sampling rather than EFB copy output.

## 2026-07-29: Cold-boot direct renderer is sharp with identical copy path

- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

After another full power-off boot, `uptime` reported one minute and no
`gcn_gx` module was resident. The module bytes were identical to the preceding
reference-renderer test. The direct-color renderer also placed the historical
conservative preamble contiguously before its first frame.

The deterministic four-quadrant, two-pixel grid appeared clear. Its 2688-byte
first-frame FIFO drained to `RDoff == WToff == 0x0a80`, every PE token
completed, and same-boot unload restored the CPU console. The webcam remained
unavailable, so sharpness was judged directly by the user.

Together with the preceding blurry reference-texture result, this is a useful
same-module, cold-boot primitive comparison, but not a filter-controlled A/B:
the embedded reference frame programs libogc's broad BP 0x53/0x54 copy filter,
while the direct path programs the driver's narrow filter. The older generated
texture tests used the narrow filter and were still blurry, but revalidate that
comparison under the corrected initialization sequence before treating it as
decisive. Keep the direct renderer as the sharp positive control.

- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

This changed only the direct-color diagnostic's horizontal and vertical grid
lines from two pixels wide to one, matching the deterministic textured
pattern's grid width. The Wii was fully powered off before the test; `uptime`
reported one minute and no GX module was resident before loading it.

The one-pixel direct grid appeared clear. The first-frame FIFO again drained
to `RDoff == WToff == 0x0a80`, all PE tokens completed, and same-boot unload
restored the CPU console. The webcam remained unavailable, so the visual
result is based on direct user observation.

This removes feature width as an explanation for the blurry textured grid.
The downstream EFB copy and VI path preserve one-pixel direct geometry, while
the texture path does not. The next tests must alter only texture-path state;
start by decoding and validating BP 0x80 texture filtering and LOD fields
against libogc and Dolphin rather than changing copy or raster state.

## 2026-07-29: Narrow-filter generated texture remains blurry

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The Wii reported 36 minutes of uptime, so this run is explicitly a warm-state
test rather than the requested cold boot. No GX module was resident before the
load. The immediately preceding GX run used the identical module bytes and
showed a clear one-pixel direct grid before unloading.

The generated renderer showed the deterministic grid, but it was blurry. Both
source buffers had the expected texture digest (`crc=a05bcbcf`,
`sum=30d9faae`, `xor=0410`, `nz=288345`). The first generated frame drained
its 960-byte FIFO to `RDoff == WToff == 0x03c0`, every PE token completed, and
same-boot unload restored the CPU console. The webcam remained unavailable.

Unlike the embedded reference blob, generated and direct renderers both use
the driver's narrow BP 0x53/0x54 copy filter. This same-module comparison
therefore confirms that the remaining blur is texture-path-specific, not a
display-copy or VI-output effect. Dolphin's `TexMode0` definition and libogc's
`GX_InitTexObjLOD()` also confirm that BP `0x80000100` already means clamp,
nearest magnification, no mipmap filter, nearest minification, diagonal LOD,
zero bias, and no anisotropy. Do not spend another test on that same encoding;
move next to texture-coordinate scale/centering and tiled-data interpretation.

- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The known-clear one-pixel direct grid rendered clearly again. All FIFO and PE
controls passed, and the module logged a post-token, cache-invalidated XFB
snapshot of 614400 bytes at physical address `0x0172e000`. However,
`/sys/kernel/debug/gcn_gx/xfb_yuyv` returned zero bytes even though its width,
height, and physical-address metadata were correct.

This is a failed positive control for the digital capture mechanism; do not
use it as captured-frame evidence. `debugfs_create_blob()` fixed the readable
length at its creation-time value of zero. Commit `9f873066c` replaces it with
a custom `simple_read_from_buffer()` file and makes the cycle script wait on
published width metadata. Revalidate that implementation against the same
clear direct pattern before capturing textured output.

- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The direct one-pixel grid was again visibly clear. The corrected module again
logged a 614400-byte post-token snapshot, and debugfs metadata reported width
640, height 480, and physical address `0x0172e000`. The custom debugfs reader
still returned zero bytes, however, because its regular-file inode retained
the creation-time length of zero and the VFS returned EOF before delivering
data through the read callback.

This is another failed capture positive control, not frame evidence. Commit
`be2905216` stores the debugfs dentry and publishes its inode size together
with the snapshot size after the cache-invalidated copy. Validate that exact
state once more against the clear direct pattern before proceeding.

- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The user again observed a clear one-pixel direct grid. After the validated PE
token, the module captured exactly 614400 bytes from physical XFB
`0x0172e000`; debugfs reported and returned the full length. The cycle script
retrieved the YUYV frame and converted it to a 640x480 PNG. Direct inspection
of that PNG showed the expected four solid quadrants and crisp one-pixel black
grid lines with no texture-like blur. All FIFO and PE controls passed, and
same-boot unload restored the CPU console.

This is the required positive control for digital XFB capture. Full-frame
snapshots obtained through this post-token, cache-invalidated path can now be
used as evidence. The next run should capture `renderer=generated` with the
same deterministic pattern and module bytes, then compare exact edge profiles
and pixels against this direct baseline instead of relying on camera output.

The user observed the familiar blurry grid. The first automatic SSH transfer
was truncated, but the immutable debugfs file continued to report and return
614400 bytes; a retry produced the complete checksum above. Both tiled source
buffers had the expected deterministic digest, every PE token completed, and
the generated FIFO drained to `RDoff == WToff == 0x03c0`.

The exact XFB is more specific than the visual report. Quadrant boundaries and
yellow diagonals are sharp, proving that gross texture dimensions, addressing,
and projection are correct. The intended one-pixel black grid is instead
broken into a regular pattern of dots and short segments across otherwise
solid regions. Horizontal-line samples vary with X and vertical-line samples
vary with Y, consistent with coordinates landing on texel boundaries and
raster interpolation precision selecting adjacent texels. The high-frequency
aliasing is what appears blurry after analog/HDMI conversion and capture.

BP `0x80000100` is already validated as nearest sampling with no mipmaps. The
next isolated test should add a positive half-texel translation to TEXMTX0:
`0.5 / 640` in S and `0.5 / 480` in T, while leaving scale, texture data,
filtering, raster state, and copy state unchanged. Success is a digital XFB
whose black grid lines are continuous and one pixel wide.

- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

This changed only TEXMTX0's translation terms from zero to positive
`0.5 / width` and `0.5 / height`. The first automatic SSH transfer was
truncated; retrying the still-live immutable snapshot returned all 614400
bytes and produced the checksums above. All FIFO, PE, and texture-digest
controls passed.

The positive bias did not make the one-pixel grid continuous. It changed the
periodic dot/segment phase and made the rising yellow diagonal visibly stair
and wander, while quadrant boundaries remained correctly positioned. The PNG
was opened beside the zero-bias baseline in GIMP for direct comparison.

This is a valid negative result: positive half-texel centering is the wrong
direction under the GX raster/texture convention used here. Because the bias
materially changes the artifact, coordinate centering remains implicated.
Test negative `0.5 / width` and `0.5 / height` next, changing only the signs
of the two translation terms.

- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

This changed only the signs of TEXMTX0's half-texel translation terms, from
positive to negative `0.5 / width` and `0.5 / height`. The unstable Wii Wi-Fi
link truncated multiple whole-file SSH reads, while the remote debugfs file
remained exactly 614400 bytes. The complete immutable frame was retrieved in
verified chunks and converted to the checksums above. All FIFO, PE, and tiled
texture-digest controls passed.

The digital XFB shows continuous, one-pixel black horizontal and vertical grid
lines across all four quadrants. The periodic dots and short segments from the
zero-bias and positive-bias captures are gone. Large-scale geometry remains
correct and the yellow diagonals remain visible. The complete PNG was opened
in GIMP beside both earlier captures.

This is the first checksum-backed fix for the textured output-quality defect.
GX's raster convention requires position-derived normalized coordinates to be
translated by negative half a texel for one-to-one framebuffer sampling. Keep
this bias. Next run `renderer=generated texture_source=console hold_frame=1`
to verify real console legibility and capture its exact XFB. Do not conflate
any remaining YUYV chroma behavior at colored edges with the now-fixed broken
texture sampling.

- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=console hold_frame=1`

The user observed that the console remained blurry, but that its blur was more
uniform and represented an overall improvement. The complete digital XFB was
retrieved in verified chunks and opened in GIMP. It shows recognizable text,
but white glyph strokes break into a checkerboard-like pattern. The residual
defect is therefore present in the GPU-produced digital frame, not introduced
only by HDMI conversion or the camera.

Both generated console submissions completed every FIFO and PE control. For
each submitted frame, the linear VFB and tiled buffer had identical sums, XOR,
and nonzero counts; differing CRCs are expected because tiling changes byte
order. The deterministic texture pattern is now clean under the same negative
half-texel state, so this residual is specific to real console input or its
linear-to-tiled path rather than the general copy/output path.

`/dev/fb0` is mmap-only on this rootfs and returned zero bytes to a read test.
Add a module debugfs snapshot of the exact linear RGB565 VFB used for the held
frame, retrieve it alongside XFB, and convert it as `rgb565be`. Validate that
source snapshot before modifying tiling or coordinates again: sharp source
plus broken XFB implicates conversion/sampling, while a broken source means GX
is accurately displaying fbcon's input.

- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=console hold_frame=1`

The module copied the exact linear VFB immediately before tiling and captured
the corresponding XFB only after the held frame's PE token completed. The Wii
Wi-Fi link again truncated large direct reads, but compressing each immutable
debugfs file on the Wii reduced them to 33763 and 46328 bytes and allowed both
complete 614400-byte frames to be retrieved. Both converted images were opened
together in GIMP.

The VFB source is sharp. Its glyph edges and one-pixel strokes are intact. The
same-frame GX-produced XFB breaks those strokes into a regular checkerboard-like
pattern. The user's display observation agrees: the negative half-texel bias
makes the blur more uniform and is an overall improvement, but it is not a
complete fix.

This decisively clears fbcon and the CPU-side source framebuffer. Dolphin's
reference RGB565 decoder also confirms the driver's intended 4x4 block order:
blocks left-to-right and top-to-bottom, with four consecutive big-endian
RGB565 pixels in each of four rows. Continue with controlled tests of fine
texture addressing, coordinate scale/rounding, and texture-cache state. Do not
change the XFB copy path or blame the captured VFB without new contradictory
evidence.

The probe assigns every source coordinate a reproducible black or white value
from a 32-bit integer hash. Its published linear source snapshot matched the
same independently generated coordinate field exactly: 153941 white and
153259 black pixels. This validates the diagnostic before interpreting GX
output. The FIFO drained, every PE token completed, and the held XFB contained
only exact Y=16 black and Y=235 white samples. GX is therefore performing
nearest selection rather than blending or corrupting pixel values.

Integer-shift correlation found one strong mapping: output displaced two
pixels right and one pixel down agrees with the intended source at 74.8107%.
The next candidates were 59.8655% at (2,0), 58.9329% at (1,0), and 53.8882%
at (3,2); unrelated mappings remain at the expected 50% chance rate. A single
constant displacement cannot explain the output. Approximately half the
pixels follow the dominant mapping while the remainder select other nearby
texels. This directly explains the checkerboard breakup of one-pixel console
strokes.

The first compressed transfer attempt also exposed a tooling limit. Probe data
compresses to roughly 90 KiB rather than the console's 34-46 KiB, and a single
SSH read still truncated. Both immutable files were recovered and checksum
validated using independently retried 16 KiB compressed chunks. Harden the
cycle script with that fallback before the next hardware test.

Next refine the probe from one random bit to multiple grayscale levels per
coordinate. That reduces accidental matches from 50% to 12.5% and permits a
more precise phase-by-phase reconstruction of which source texel each raster
position selects. Do not change sampling state until that mapping is measured.
