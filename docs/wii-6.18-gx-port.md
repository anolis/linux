# Wii Linux 6.18 GX port test ledger

This ledger tracks the modern-kernel port of the Wii VI framebuffer and the
reloadable GX accelerator. Hardware conclusions require a committed source
state and a checksum-verified deployed image.

## 2026-07-28: CPU framebuffer positive control (invalid build)

- Source implementation: `89a40599d` (`video: fbdev: port the Wii VI
  framebuffer to Linux 6.18`)
- Deployment helper state: `9ad81d7be238`
- Deployed image SHA-256:
  `cfb0877630a343ad8b28b3b1483b6916905ce0e9f203b435bb48a0de05f21c2c`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #9 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 15:15:21 CDT 2026`

Wi-Fi and SSH passed: `wlan0` associated, received `10.3.10.12`, and accepted
the restored root public key when the client enabled `ssh-rsa` compatibility
for the rootfs's OpenSSH 6.7 server.

The framebuffer test is invalid, not negative. `/proc/fb` was empty and no
`gcn-vifb` platform driver appeared. Runtime config inspection showed
`CONFIG_FB=y` and `CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y`, but no
`CONFIG_FB_GAMECUBE=y`. The build had reused a stale `.config`; adding the
symbol to `wii_defconfig` does not update an existing `.config` through an
incremental build.

The deployment helper now runs `make wii_defconfig` before every build and
refuses to continue unless `.config` contains `CONFIG_FB_GAMECUBE=y`. Retest
the CPU framebuffer before porting or loading any GX accelerator code.

## 2026-07-28: CPU framebuffer probe with corrected config

- Source implementation: `89a40599d`
- Deployed image SHA-256:
  `03601c0fbd69889d5a8033fff7be0f37ddc0821ca7e2098767681a6ba791f974`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #10 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 15:47:50 CDT 2026`

The corrected image contained `CONFIG_FB_GAMECUBE=y`. The platform driver
registered and bound to `c002000.video`, proving the Kconfig, build, DT match,
and initcall paths. Probe then failed with `-EIO` after both
`request_mem_region()` and `ioremap()` rejected XFB physical range
`0x01698000+0x00168000`.

This is expected modern-kernel behavior: the DTS reserves the XFB with
`/memreserve/`, but it remains classified as System RAM. Modern PowerPC does
not permit an `ioremap()` alias of System RAM. Use `memremap(...,
MEMREMAP_WB)` to obtain the direct mapping and explicitly flush CPU-written
XFB cache lines before the noncoherent VI scans them.

The same boot also confirmed that the rootfs's static `/dev/console` is a
regular file and `CONFIG_DEVTMPFS` was disabled. Enable devtmpfs in
`wii_defconfig`; the external `init-diag.sh` has already been updated to mount
it, stop repeating physical-card pull banners, and launch a local shell when
`/dev/fb0` exists.

## 2026-07-28: CPU framebuffer positive control passed

- XFB mapping implementation: `204740990`
- Deployed image SHA-256:
  `ec7660bd41bea735994f45463ed5077e5ecfad8a119271b7e0b4eed58572da52`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #11 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 16:55:32 CDT 2026`

All positive controls passed:

- `gcn-vifb` bound to `c002000.video` without warnings or faults.
- `/proc/fb` reported `0 gcn-vifb`.
- fbcon switched to an 80x30 color framebuffer console.
- sysfs reported 640x480, 16 bits per pixel.
- devtmpfs provided real `/dev/console`, `/dev/tty0`, and `/dev/fb0` nodes.
- Wi-Fi retained `10.3.10.12` and key-based SSH remained stable.
- A marker written remotely to `/dev/tty0` was visually confirmed on the Wii.

The CPU RGB565-to-YUYV path on Linux 6.18 is therefore the new known-good
fallback baseline. Proceed with the separately reloadable GX accelerator;
module unload must restore this exact live CPU console.

## 2026-07-28: First reloadable GX module cycle passed

- GX module implementation: `9500ee207`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `fcd616b8c19c98e2ff061020cbfcfbafe62de5d0d1895beca0d42e35e5700c2c`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=reference hold_frame=1`

The module loaded successfully, registered with gcnfb, mapped PE finish hwirq
10 to Linux IRQ 23, and completed the seed, copy-clear, libogc init, and two
reference-renderer submissions. Every FIFO drained to `RDoff == WToff`; all
four PE finish IRQs arrived; token waits completed in 310-860 microseconds.

The displayed GX frame was visually confirmed blurry, reproducing the known
3.15 accelerator defect on Linux 6.18. This is a useful reproduction, not a
port regression: `rmmod gcn_gx` immediately restored the clear live CPU
console without reboot, also visually confirmed. Wi-Fi and SSH remained live.

The modern reloadable investigation loop is therefore validated. Subsequent
GX-only changes require only `tools/wii-gx-cycle.sh`; no kernel rebuild, card
movement, or rootfs write is needed unless reserved-memory requirements
change.

## 2026-07-28: Generated renderer bounded-frame control

- Source state: `f9cc3d1927a3`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `fcd616b8c19c98e2ff061020cbfcfbafe62de5d0d1895beca0d42e35e5700c2c`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated hold_frame=1`

The generated renderer completed the same seed, copy-clear, isolated libogc
init, and two live-frame submissions as the reference test. All four PE
finish IRQs arrived, token waits completed in 410-860 microseconds, and every
FIFO submission drained to `RDoff == WToff`. The VFB and tiled-texture digest
sums matched for both captured live frames.

A full-frame capture from the live webcam feed showed real spatial
corruption: console content was compressed and repeated in several vertical
regions, with additional vertical duplication. This is materially different
from a solid copy-clear result and proves that the generated path publishes
changing framebuffer content, but with incorrect texture sampling or display
layout. After `rmmod gcn_gx`, a second full-frame capture showed the clear,
full-width CPU console. The camera and VI mode are therefore valid controls;
the repeated layout is produced by the GX path.

Next isolate texture geometry before changing raster state. The source and
tiled-buffer digests matching rules out corruption in the CPU tiling loop,
but does not validate the GX texture dimensions, format, cache/TMEM state,
texture coordinates, or EFB-to-XFB copy stride.

## 2026-07-28: Texture geometry passed, sharpness failed

- Test implementation: `8e376ece808f`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `842c368f90d943cfbaad3dfba8c4190dc384b020ce574014f15e0fd714a8eff3`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

The deterministic tiled RGB565 texture rendered with correct large-scale
geometry on real hardware. A full-frame webcam capture showed the expected
red upper-left, dark-green upper-right, blue lower-left, and white lower-right
quadrants. Black 32-pixel grid lines covered the full frame and the yellow
diagonal markers crossed the expected geometry. The user directly observed
that the GX output was blurry, however, while the CPU-console control after
module unload was sharp. This is a spatial-layout positive control, not an
image-quality positive control.

All four PE finish IRQs arrived, token waits completed in 410-860
microseconds, and every FIFO drained to `RDoff == WToff`. Both texture buffers
produced the same deterministic digest (`crc=a05bcbcf`, `sum=30d9faae`,
`xor=0410`, `nz=288345`). Module unload then restored the clear CPU console,
also confirmed with a full-frame capture.

Because the pattern uses the same MEM1 buffers, cache flush, RGB565 texture
descriptor, generated command state, draw geometry, EFB copy, XFB stride, and
presentation path as the corrupt console test, it rules out gross dimension,
axis, tiling-block, viewport, and stride mistakes. It does not rule out
half-texel sampling, texture filtering, EFB copy filtering, or another
downstream quality issue. The repeated/compressed console layout may still
involve the live VFB contract or linear-to-tiled copy, but the shared blur
requires auditing the GX sampling and copy-filter state first.

## 2026-07-28: Narrow display-copy filter did not fix blur

- Test implementation: `d6c394313cbf`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `c6ad95d20beced0534d1764ed76d7c43badcc6cc924cdf1575ce2b187c49d424`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=generated texture_source=pattern hold_frame=1`

This test changed only display-copy filter BP registers 0x53 and 0x54. The
previous values encoded the broad video-mode coefficients
`[8,8,10,12,10,8,8]`, despite a source comment claiming `vf=false`. The test
used libogc's exact `GX_SetCopyFilter(GX_FALSE, NULL, GX_FALSE, NULL)` values,
which encode `[0,0,21,22,21,0,0]`.

The user still observed blurry GX output, and a full-frame webcam capture
showed no meaningful sharpness improvement over the broad-filter capture.
FIFO drains, PE finish IRQs, tokens, pattern digest, and spatial geometry all
remained correct. Module unload restored the CPU console.

The broad seven-tap copy filter is therefore ruled out as the primary blur
cause. Keep the narrow values because they accurately implement the stated
`vf=false` policy, but do not credit them as a visual fix. Next render a
hard-edged direct-color EFB pattern without texture sampling, then copy it
through the same XFB path. A sharp direct-color result implicates texture
sampling; a blurry result implicates the EFB-copy/presentation path.

## 2026-07-28: Direct-color EFB pattern was clear

- Test implementation: `acc19b0770dc`
- Kernel image SHA-256:
  `87f3732a65c836824ba8bcff450a872d5fc036c990dc244a93262cc6d86e041a`
- GX module SHA-256:
  `c6037cd65e8d83f20026f7f1869820a21c3a015710819a159b6abdac507b04b8`
- Runtime kernel: `6.18.40-wii+ #12 PREEMPT Tue Jul 28 17:07:44 CDT 2026`
- Parameters: `renderer=direct texture_source=console hold_frame=1`

The direct renderer bypassed VFB reads, linear-to-tiled conversion, MEM1
texture buffers, texture descriptors, texture coordinates, TMEM, and texture
sampling. It drew four vertex-color quadrants and a two-pixel 32x32 black grid
directly into the EFB, then used the same PE fence, EFB-to-XFB copy, XFB
stride, VI scanout, and presentation path as the blurry textured tests.

The user observed a clear image. A full-frame webcam capture independently
confirmed materially sharp grid edges and quadrant boundaries. All four PE
finish IRQs arrived, token waits completed in 410-420 microseconds, and FIFO
submissions drained to `RDoff == WToff`; the direct frame used 2688 command
bytes. Module unload restored the CPU console.

This is a valid positive control for the downstream display path. EFB copy,
the narrow BP 0x53/0x54 filter, XFB stride, VI presentation, and the capture
path do not cause the texture blur. The remaining blur is in the texture path:
texture coordinates, LOD/filter state, TMEM/cache behavior, or sampling. The
correct large-scale textured-pattern geometry makes a gross coordinate or
dimension error unlikely. Audit BP 0x80 texMode0 encoding first, especially
min/mag filter and LOD fields, against libogc and Dolphin.
